  <div class="description">A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

  <h2 class="destination">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
  <div class="description">The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.

    <h1>How the Rise of Soccer in the US Is Changing the Face of Youth Sports</h1>
    <h2>The focus on soccer in youth sports programs is exploding nation-wide</h2>
    <p>When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was it. Well it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer, across the US. This year, 3 million kids
      played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range the MLS has surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.</p>
    <p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the Women's World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely not chump change. And those advertisers,
      like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the country. </p>
    <p>Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a continued rise in popularity in soccer across the country for years to come. </p>
