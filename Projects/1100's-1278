  <h2>Austria</h2>
    <p>Austria was a now after years of being a march, it's own Indepednt nationstate at least, within the Kingdom of Germany and therefore the Holy Roman Empire which as many will say, wasn't an empire, certainly not roman and inexplicably not Holy, with this came a rise of a new house in European affairs. The Badenburgs were a small house but for the High Germanic/Bavarian areas they would have quite an impact, they married into many royal families typically do but, when Leopold V arose inherited the very bountiful area of Styria, brought recodifed laws and joined many of the crusades fighting everywhere from Iberia to Palestine. Under him Vienna became the center of culture for Germany and brought many great schools of thought, later on he would strife with his son Fredrick which would later cause the Inheritance of this Duchy to the Hapsburg family through a conveluted mess where Austria was Reinheited by the then Excommunicated Bohemians who in turn gave it to the said Hapsburgs even though both the Badenburg and Hapsburgs were adored by the pope of the time and had engaged in the crusades under his command </p>
