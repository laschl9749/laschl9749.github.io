  <h2>Austria</h2>
  <p>
    Austria was a now after years of being the Ruler of the H.R.E was now embroiled within the tangled web that made up current European affairs as well as it's own Empire, after a few Years within the Napoleonic Wars it had dismantled the HRE and was part of the new order of Europe, with it came a new era of warfare, governance and heights or lows in every regard, but this section of the website shall but talking specifically about those said wars and specifically the battle of Waterloo </p>
    
    <h4>The Napoleonic Wars Overall</h4>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5d7Toc2wuSQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscree></iframe>
    <p>The battle of Waterloo completely changed the face of European History, it ended the future events that Napoleon could have caused as well as an end to the French Dominance of Western and Central Europe as well as the First French Empire. After being exiled after the Sixth Coalition, he is exiled to the isle of Elba and after only ten months he hears rumors that the people would once again rally behind him, he sets off and assuming the Congress of Vienna will slow the former allies arrives in Southern France and has the army sent to arrest him rally behind him, they overthrow the Monarch and march to end the impeding attacks before they even come, he along with 128,000 men march towards beligum where the Duke of Welligton and Prince Blücher, to hopefully end the war quickly from a position of strength before the coalition and their forces can seize him and France. The French are a match for either force on their own but toghether they are near doubled in number with 215,000 men on the coalitions side if they can join toghether, he aims to crush one after the other that way his superior tetics and morale crushes them, He has his men try to spear through the two armies and sends his left flank to capture an important cross-road, there the French engages the Duke holding them off long enough for the main force of Napoleon to the Princes Army and after a long slugging match defeats them but does not break them, so he sends the right flank to engage the retreating army, the Duke not knowing of this defeat retreats to a defensive postion 8 miles south of the city of Brussels, near the village of Waterloo, therefore after recieivng a message from the Prince promising aid the next morning he decides to set up and wait for Napoleon, his troops behind a gentle ridge, the right flank on within a heavily wooded farm, the center in an open plain and the left behind a river on another farm all filled with elite soilders. The numbers are even but the forces are rag-tag and many haven't seen a single battle compared to Napoleons Veterans. The day dawns bright and fair, Napoleon sends a general to pin down the Prince and their forces while he goes after the Duke, he waits for the ground to harden for easier movement but these hours will cost him the battle as the main force of the Prince evades the other force Napoleon sent, he engaes at 11am and encounters harsh resistance, the men holding onto the positions for as long as they can, they eventually push through the gate only to be trapped and slaughtered by the Dukes forces. At 1:30 the French attack the center of the Dukes forces and are completely repelled by a counter charge, but the calvary extend too far and many generals are killed. Later they think they see the Dukes forces retreating and so order a calvary charge, but no, the calvary engage hollowed circles of men with bayonets and rifles, immune to any attacks by the calvary. With this the Prince with his main force arrives threating the back lines of Napoleons Army, forcing him to send reserves to capture the defense they lost, at 6pm though they capture and important farm allowing artillery to fire directly on the Dukes army, it looks grim but Napoleon is running low on manpower, turning to his ultimate reserves, the Elite Imperial Guard, the most feared and most battle hardened warriors of Europe, he sends them to engage Welligton 3000 in all, the Dukes forces run volley after volley into their midst, culling them and then attach bayonets for a charge, the Guard waver and retreat. Wellington orders a advance sensing victory, the Prince orders the same after seeing this and the French army shatters, only the old guard remains, Napoleon is captured and forced to abidcate and then sent to Georgia in exile.</p>
