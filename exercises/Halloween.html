<p>An ode to hallow's eve; <i>"The impenetrable veil thins. The veil that keeps us hidden. From the truths. Spirits walk amongst us. on All Hallow's Eve. Little pumpkins light the way. Their knowing smiles. Hid by sneers, and big toothy grins. Even the southern airs feels strange. The thinning of the veil. Turning into a birks cool day. Leaves changing autumn colors. As they race to their own demise. Crumpled by the small feet of children. Playing, thowing leaves. Red veined leaves. Laying on the altar, each for a loved one. Lost over the past year. Lovingly picked. To sit in this place of familial honor. Knowing their embraces are plenty.  </i>
